## 1. SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) {#sort}

**Characteristics**:
- Minimal and fast approach
- Based on Kalman Filter for prediction
- Association via Hungarian Algorithm with IoU
- Ideal for real-time applications

**C++ Implementation**:
```cpp
class Sort {
private:
    unsigned int max_age;
    int min_hits;
    double iouThreshold;
    std::vector<KalmanTracker> trackers;
    
public:
    std::vector<TrackingBox> update(const std::vector<TrackingBox>& detections);
};
```

### Algorithm Overview

SORT follows a straightforward tracking-by-detection approach:

1. **Prediction Phase**: Predicts track positions using constant velocity Kalman Filter
2. **Association Phase**: Associates detections to existing tracks using IoU and Hungarian algorithm
3. **Update Phase**: Updates track states with matched detections
4. **Management Phase**: Creates new tracks for unmatched detections, removes old tracks

### Key Components

- **Kalman Filter**: Uses 7-dimensional state vector (position, scale, aspect ratio, velocities)
- **Hungarian Algorithm**: Solves optimal assignment problem for detection-track matching
- **IoU Matching**: Primary similarity metric for association decisions
- **Track Lifecycle**: Simple age-based track management with hit/miss counters

### Technical Approach

- **State Representation**: Center coordinates, scale, aspect ratio, and their velocities
- **Motion Model**: Assumes constant velocity with Gaussian noise
- **Association Strategy**: Maximum IoU matching with configurable threshold
- **Track Initialization**: Immediate track creation for unassociated detections

### Advantages
- **High speed**: 100+ FPS on modern hardware
- **Implementation simplicity**: Minimal code complexity
- **Low computational requirements**: Suitable for resource-constrained environments
- **Proven reliability**: Widely tested baseline

### Limitations
- **No Re-ID handling**: No appearance features for robust association
- **Problematic with long occlusions**: Cannot recover tracks after extended disappearance
- **Frequent ID switches**: In complex scenes with similar objects
- **Pure motion model**: Relies only on motion prediction, vulnerable to erratic movements

## 2. BoTSORT (Bootstrapping and Track re-IDentification) {#botsort}

**Characteristics**:
- Extension of ByteTrack with Re-identification
- Appearance features for robust association
- Global Motion Compensation (GMC)
- Advanced occlusion handling

### Algorithm Overview

BoTSORT enhances ByteTrack with sophisticated re-identification and motion compensation:

### Key Innovations

#### 1. Re-identification Integration
- **Deep Features**: CNN-based appearance features for robust object association
- **Feature Smoothing**: Exponential moving average of appearance features over time
- **Multi-modal Matching**: Combines motion prediction with appearance similarity
- **Feature History**: Maintains appearance history for recovery after long occlusions

#### 2. Global Motion Compensation (GMC)
- **Camera Motion Estimation**: Detects and compensates for global camera movement

- **Adaptive Thresholding**: Different confidence thresholds for different track states
- **Class ID Tracking**: Maintains object classification with weighted voting
- **Track Recovery**: Re-identifies lost tracks using appearance features

#### 4. Hierarchical Association
- **Primary Matching**: High-confidence detections with tracked tracks (IoU + appearance)
- **Secondary Matching**: Low-confidence detections with lost tracks (appearance-based)
- **Tertiary Recovery**: Long-term re-identification for extended occlusions

### Tracking Pipeline

1. **Feature Extraction**: Extract Re-ID features for each detection
2. **Motion Prediction**: Kalman Filter prediction with GMC compensation
3. **Multi-stage Association**:
   - High-confidence detections with tracked tracks (IoU + appearance)
   - Low-confidence detections with lost tracks (appearance-based)
   - Remaining detections create new tracks
4. **Track Management**: Update states, handle track lifecycle

### Re-identification Module

**Feature Extraction**:
```cpp
FeatureVector BoTSORT::_extract_features(const cv::Mat& frame,
                                        const cv::Rect_<float>& bbox_tlwh) {
    // Crop detection region
    cv::Rect roi = bbox_to_rect(bbox_tlwh);
    cv::Mat crop = frame(roi);
    
    // Preprocess for ReID model
    cv::Mat input = preprocess_reid(crop);
    
    // ONNX inference
    auto features = reid_model->inference(input);
    return features;
}
```

**Appearance Distance Calculation**:
```cpp
float appearance_distance(const FeatureVector& feat1, const FeatureVector& feat2) {
    // Cosine similarity
    float dot_product = feat1.dot(feat2);
    float norm1 = feat1.norm();
    float norm2 = feat2.norm();
    return 1.0f - (dot_product / (norm1 * norm2));
}
```

### Advanced Features

#### Track State Management
```cpp
void Track::mark_lost() { state = TrackState::Lost; }
void Track::mark_long_lost() { state = TrackState::LongLost; }
void Track::mark_removed() { state = TrackState::Removed; }

// Automatic state transitions based on track age
if (time_since_update > max_time_lost) {
    mark_long_lost();
}
```

#### Class ID Management
```cpp
void Track::_update_class_id(uint8_t class_id, float score) {
    _class_hist.push_back({class_id, score});
    
    // Keep history size limited
    if (_class_hist.size() > max_class_history) {
        _class_hist.erase(_class_hist.begin());
    }
    
    // Update class based on weighted frequency
    std::map<uint8_t, float> class_weights;
    for (const auto& entry : _class_hist) {
        class_weights[entry.first] += entry.second;
    }
    
    // Select class with highest weighted frequency
    auto best_class = std::max_element(class_weights.begin(), class_weights.end(),
        [](const auto& a, const auto& b) { return a.second < b.second; });
    
    _class_id = best_class->first;
}
```

### Advantages

## 3. ByteTrack {#bytetrack}

**Characteristics**:
- Use of low-confidence detections
- Hierarchical association (high-conf → low-conf)
- Robustness to imperfect detections
- Balance between accuracy and speed

### Core Innovation

ByteTrack's key insight is leveraging low-confidence detections typically discarded by other trackers. This simple but effective approach significantly improves tracking continuity.

### Algorithm Strategy

#### 1. Confidence-based Detection Processing
- **High-confidence Detections**: Primary associations with existing tracks
- **Low-confidence Detections**: Secondary recovery mechanism for lost tracks
- **Hierarchical Matching**: Two-stage association process prevents incorrect matches
- **Adaptive Thresholding**: Different confidence levels for different association stages

#### 2. Two-stage Association
- **Stage 1**: High-confidence detections matched to active tracks using IoU
- **Stage 2**: Low-confidence detections matched to unmatched tracks with relaxed thresholds
- **Kalman Prediction**: Enhanced motion prediction for better association
- **Track Recovery**: Recovers temporarily lost tracks using weak detections

#### 3. Enhanced Track Management
- **Improved Lifecycle**: Better track initialization and termination logic
- **Buffer Management**: Configurable track buffer for handling temporary losses
- **State Transitions**: Smooth transitions between tracked/lost states
- **Noise Resilience**: Robust handling of detection noise and false positives

### Key Features

#### Confidence-based Processing
- **High confidence threshold**: 0.6-0.7 (typical)
- **Low confidence threshold**: 0.1-0.3 (typical)
- **Dynamic thresholding**: Adaptive based on scene complexity

#### Kalman Filter Enhancement
- Similar to SORT but with better track management
- Improved track initialization and deletion logic
- Enhanced state prediction for lost tracks

### Advantages
- **Recovers "lost" tracks**: Low-confidence detections help maintain continuity
- **Robust to noise**: Hierarchical matching reduces false associations
- **Competitive performance**: Good results on MOT17/20 benchmarks
- **Moderate complexity**: More sophisticated than SORT, simpler than BoTSORT
- **Speed efficiency**: Faster than appearance-based methods

### Limitations
- **Still no appearance features**: Relies purely on motion and IoU
- **Parameter sensitivity**: Confidence thresholds need tuning per dataset
- **Limited long-term tracking**: Cannot handle extended occlusions well

### Performance Comparison

| Metric | SORT | ByteTrack | BoTSORT |
|--------|------|-----------|---------|
| **Speed (FPS)** | 100+ | 30-60 | 10-30 |
| **MOTA (MOT17)** | ~45% | ~60% | ~65% |
| **IDF1 (MOT17)** | ~40% | ~55% | ~70% |
| **HOTA (MOT17)** | ~35% | ~50% | ~60% |
| **Memory Usage** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Implementation Complexity** | Low | Medium | High |

### External Benchmark Reference

The numbers above are indicative. For an independently measured, apples-to-apples
comparison across algorithms, use the [Roboflow `trackers` benchmarks](https://trackers.roboflow.com/)
([repo](https://github.com/roboflow/trackers)), which reports HOTA on MOT17,
SportsMOT, SoccerNet and DanceTrack with default parameters:

| Algorithm | MOT17 HOTA | SportsMOT HOTA | SoccerNet HOTA | DanceTrack HOTA | Available here |
|-----------|-----------:|---------------:|---------------:|----------------:|----------------|
| [SORT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00763) | 58.4 | 70.8 | 81.6 | 47.2 | ✅ |
| [ByteTrack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06864) | 60.1 | 73.0 | 84.0 | 53.3 | ✅ |
| [OC-SORT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14360) | 61.9 | 71.7 | 78.4 | 54.1 | ❌ |
| [BoT-SORT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14651) | 63.7 | 73.8 | 84.5 | 57.8 | ✅ |
| [C-BIoU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14317) | 63.0 | 73.1 | 82.6 | 56.7 | ❌ |
| [McByte](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01373) | **64.1** | **76.5** | **85.0** | **67.2** | ❌ |

Read these as relative ordering, not as targets for this project's C++
implementations:

- **Detections differ per dataset.** MOT17, SportsMOT and DanceTrack use YOLOX
  detections; SoccerNet uses oracle ground-truth boxes, which is why its scores
  sit 20+ HOTA above MOT17. Tracking metrics move with detector quality.
- **Default parameters only.** The comparison page also reports grid-searched
  configurations, where the gaps between trackers narrow considerably (on MOT17,
  tuned SORT reaches 60.4 against ByteTrack's 60.5).
- **The McByte row has a different basis.** It is author-reported (PR #513)
  against a BoT-SORT-without-Re-ID baseline rather than measured in the same
  five-tracker sweep, though that baseline matches the BoT-SORT run above.
- **Benchmark version:** `trackers` v2.3.0 (released 2026-03-16).

### Feature Comparison

| Feature | SORT | ByteTrack | BoTSORT |
|---------|------|-----------|---------|
| **Motion Model** | Kalman Filter | Enhanced Kalman | Kalman + GMC |
| **Appearance Model** | None | None | Deep ReID |
| **Association Method** | IoU only | IoU hierarchical | IoU + Appearance |
| **Occlusion Handling** | Basic | Improved | Advanced |
| **ID Switch Robustness** | Poor | Good | Excellent |
| **Real-time Performance** | Excellent | Good | Fair |
